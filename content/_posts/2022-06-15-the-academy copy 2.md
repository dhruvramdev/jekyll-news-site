Days after the Centre initiated eviction proceedings, Congress is likely to vacate its bungalow in Delhi's Chanakyapuri within a fortnight. The property at C-II/109 Chanakyapuri which was allotted to the Congress party recently has been occupied by former Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Gowda. The monthly rent of this bungalow is Rs 5,07,911. Notably, the last time the rent paid was in August 2013. As of date, penalties including all other charges now stand at Rs 3.08 crores.
