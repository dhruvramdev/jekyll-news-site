Hockey India has announced an 18-member squad for the men's hockey team for 2022 Commonwealth Games, beginning July 28, with Manpreet Singh returning as captain. Dragflicker Harmanpreet Singh has been named as the vice-captain. The Indian team has been grouped in Pool B along with England, Canada, Wales and Ghana and will begin their campaign on July 31 against Ghana.

In their previous outing at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, India suffered disappointment finishing fourth. However, after an impressive outing in the FIH Pro League this year, the Indian team is poised to achieve success in Birmingham. 

Speaking about the team selection, Chief Coach Graham Reid said, "We have gone with a tried-and-tested team for the Commonwealth Games. These players have the experience of playing top teams in high-pressure games in the FIH Pro League which was good exposure for us ahead of the prestigious quadrennial event.

After a brief break when we return home from the Netherlands, we will resume camp in SAI, Bengaluru where we will analyze our performance against Belgium and Netherlands. While there are many takeaways from this outing in FIH Pro League, there surely are a few areas that we can improve upon ahead of the Commonwealth Games," asserted Reid.

Indian Men's Team for CWG: Manpreet Singh (Captain), Harmanpreet Singh (Vice-Captain), Sreejesh PR (GK), Krishan Bahadur Pathak (GK), Varun Kumar, Surender Kumar, Amit Rohidas, Jugraj Singh, Jarmanpreet Singh, Hardik Singh, Vivek Sagar Prasad, Shamsher Singh, Akashdeep Singh, Nilakanta Sharma, Mandeep Singh, Gurjant Singh, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay and Abhishek.
